The Phantom of the Opera really existed. He was not, as long believed, a creature of the artists' imagination, of the superstition of the directors, or a product of the absurd and impressionable brains of the ballet ladies, their mothers, the boxers, the dressing room attendants, or the janitor. Yes, he existed in the flesh, though he took on the complete appearance of a real ghost; that is, of a spectral nuance.
When I began to search the archives of the National Academy of Music, I was immediately struck by the surprising coincidences between the phenomena attributed to the "ghost" and the most extraordinary and fantastic tragedy that ever excited the Parisian upper classes; And I quickly conceived the idea that this tragedy could reasonably be explained by the phenomena in question. The events are not more than thirty years old; and it would not be difficult to find to-day, in the foyer of ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men on whose word one could absolutely count, who would remember as if they were yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions which accompanied the abduction of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Viscount de Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body was found by the lake that exists in the low cellars of the Opera on the side of the rue Scribe. But none of these witnesses had until now thought that there was a reason to connect the more or less legendary figure of the Phantom of the Opera to this terrible story.
The truth was slow to enter my mind, intrigued by an investigation that, at every moment, was complicated by events that, at first glance, could be considered superhuman; And more than once I was on the verge of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in the desperate pursuit of a vain image. Finally, I received proof that my forebodings had not deceived me, and I was rewarded for all my efforts the day I became certain that the Phantom of the Opera was more than just a shadow.
